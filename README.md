# test

This repository currently has minimal code. Documentation scaffolding has been added.

- Primary docs entry: `docs/index.md`
- API docs overview: `docs/api/README.md`
- Components docs: `docs/components/README.md`

To generate language-specific API docs once code exists, see guides under `docs/api/` or run `scripts/generate-docs.sh`.
